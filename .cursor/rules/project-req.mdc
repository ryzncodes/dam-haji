Introduction and Overview
Purpose: This document details the requirements for the Dam Haji web application—a digital adaptation of the traditional Malaysian board game similar to checkers.
Background: The game, known locally for its strategic depth and cultural significance, is now being reimagined as an interactive web application using Next.js.
Summary: The web app should enable players to play the game online (single-player and multiplayer modes), participate in tournaments, and track leaderboards while preserving the traditional game rules.
Vision and Objectives
Vision: To create an engaging, culturally rich online platform that faithfully adapts the traditional Dam Haji board game while leveraging modern web technologies.
Objectives:
Provide an intuitive interface replicating the real-life game experience.
Support multiple modes: casual play, competitive tournaments, and learning modules.
Ensure scalability and responsiveness with Next.js.
Enhance community engagement with built-in social and competitive features.
Stakeholders and Target Audience
Stakeholders:
Game organizers and administrators.
Competitive players and community leaders.
Casual players interested in local cultural games.
Target Audience:
Local communities familiar with the traditional board game.
New players curious about strategy board games.
Esports and board game enthusiasts.
Scope
In-Scope:
Web-based gameplay (gameboard UI, player interactions, game rule enforcement).
Multiplayer functionality (real-time or asynchronous play).
User accounts and profile management.
Tournament management and leaderboard integration.
Out-of-Scope:
Native mobile apps.
Extensive AI gameplay (for initial release).
Offline play.
Product Features and Requirements
Game Mechanics
Rule Enforcement: Accurately implement mandatory capture rules and movement logic.
Board Representation: A digital board reflecting the traditional checkered layout.
Animations: Visual feedback on moves, jumps, and captures.
User Experience & UI
Responsive Design: Ensure a consistent experience on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
Intuitive Layout: Clear indication of active players, available moves, and game status.
Tutorial Mode: Guided instructions for new users.
User Account and Profiles
Authentication: Secure login via email/social media.
Profile Management: User profiles including game statistics, rankings, and historical performance.
Social Integration: Option to share achievements and challenge friends.
Multiplayer and Tournament Features
Matchmaking: Option for real-time gameplay or asynchronous challenges.
Tournaments: Organized events with brackets, leaderboards, and tracking of wins/losses.
Ranking System: Elo-like scoring to rank players and add competitive depth.
Administrative Dashboard
Game Monitoring: Tools for organizers to manage tournaments, monitor game sessions, and review reports.
Content Management: Update game rules, event notifications, and announcements.
User Management: Manage user reports, bans, and feedback.
Analytics and Reporting
Usage Analytics: Track user engagement, match statistics, and game duration.
Performance Metrics: Monitor server performance and latency metrics, especially for real-time games.
Technical Requirements and Architecture
Framework and Technologies
Frontend: Next.js (React framework) for server-side rendering and route optimization.
Backend: Node.js server with RESTful API endpoints; possible use of WebSockets for real-time gameplay.
Database: Options like PostgreSQL or MongoDB for persistent user and game data.
Hosting/Deployment: Vercel (for Next.js) or another scalable cloud provider.
Frontend Architecture
Component-Based Design: Reusable UI components for the board, pieces, menus, etc.
Routing: Next.js dynamic routing for game rooms, profiles, and dashboards.
State Management: Context API or Redux for managing game state and user sessions.
Backend Architecture & APIs
API Endpoints: Endpoints for game management, user authentication, tournament handling, etc.
Real-Time Communication: Integrate WebSockets (or frameworks like Socket.io) for real-time updates.
Microservices: Consider a microservices approach for scalability if the need arises.
Database and Storage
User Data: Store profile information, game statistics, and rankings.
Game State: Persist current game state and historical match data.
Security: Ensure encryption at rest and in transit.
Real-time Communication
WebSockets/Socket.io: Used for real-time gameplay, updates, and notifications.
Security and Authentication
Authentication: Implement JWT for securing API routes.
Data Validation: Sanitize inputs and validate user moves on the server.
Compliance: Follow best practices for data privacy and security.
Milestones and Timeline
Phase 1 – Requirements and Design: Finalize PRD and design prototypes.
Phase 2 – Core Development (MVP): Develop game board and core mechanics.
Phase 3 – Multiplayer and Tournament Features: Integrate multiplayer communication and create tournament modules.
Phase 4 – Testing and QA: Rigorous testing including usability, unit tests, and integration tests.
Phase 5 – Launch and Feedback Loop: Deploy MVP, gather user feedback, and plan iterative improvements.
Assumptions, Risks, and Mitigations
Assumptions:
Users have basic familiarity with web-based board games.
Initial load will be moderate and can scale with proper cloud infrastructure.
Risks:
Real-time communication latency issues.
Security vulnerabilities with user data.
Mitigations:
Use proven libraries and frameworks.
Conduct regular security audits and performance tests.
