## Introduction
The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed project roadmap for the development and launch of the Dam Haji web application. This roadmap is designed to guide the team through each phase of the project from initial planning to post-launch enhancements. The project leverages Next.js for its modern, server-side rendered web application framework, ensuring a scalable and responsive platform for both casual and competitive players.

## Project Phases and Timeline

### Phase 1: Planning & Requirement Finalization (Weeks 1-2)
- **Objectives:**
  - Finalize the Product Requirements Document (PRD).
  - Develop UI wireframes and design prototypes.
  - Create architecture diagrams and choose key technologies (Next.js, Node.js, WebSockets, etc.).
  
- **Deliverables:**
  - Completed PRD
  - UI/UX wireframes and design mockups
  - Detailed technical architecture document

### Phase 2: MVP Development (Weeks 3-8)
- **Objectives:**
  - Set up the Next.js project and development environment.
  - Implement core game mechanics (game board, move logic, capture rules).
  - Develop user authentication and basic profile management.
  - Create a responsive UI for game play.
  
- **Deliverables:**
  - Basic game board with functioning move logic
  - Secure user authentication system
  - Responsive and interactive UI components

### Phase 3: Multiplayer & Tournament Integration (Weeks 9-12)
- **Objectives:**
  - Integrate real-time communication using WebSockets (or Socket.io) for multiplayer games.
  - Develop matchmaking features and room creation for real-time and asynchronous games.
  - Implement tournament modules and leaderboard tracking.
  
- **Deliverables:**
  - Multiplayer game sessions with real-time updates
  - Functional matchmaking and game room management
  - Tournament and leaderboard features integrated into the application

### Phase 4: Testing and Quality Assurance (Weeks 13-16)
- **Objectives:**
  - Conduct rigorous testing including unit, integration, and user acceptance tests.
  - Gather feedback from beta testers.
  - Optimize performance and fix critical bugs.
  
- **Deliverables:**
  - Comprehensive testing reports
  - Improved UI/UX based on feedback
  - Stable and bug-fixed version for launch

### Phase 5: Launch (Weeks 17-18)
- **Objectives:**
  - Deploy the web application to production (using Vercel or a similar platform).
  - Roll out marketing and community engagement initiatives.
  - Finalize user documentation and support channels.
  
- **Deliverables:**
  - Live, production-ready web application
  - Marketing materials and launch announcements
  - Complete user guides and documentation

### Phase 6: Post-Launch Enhancements (Ongoing)
- **Objectives:**
  - Monitor user engagement and system performance.
  - Gather continuous feedback and implement improvements.
  - Explore additional features such as advanced analytics, AI-driven gameplay suggestions, and expanded social integrations.
  
- **Deliverables:**
  - Regular feature updates and patches
  - Expanded functionality based on user feedback
  - Long-term roadmap adjustments and scaling strategy

## Assumptions, Risks, and Mitigation

- **Assumptions:**
  - The initial user base will scale moderately post-launch.
  - Cloud infrastructure will support real-time features without significant latency.
  - Users have basic familiarity with web-based board games.

- **Risks:**
  - Performance bottlenecks during multiplayer sessions.
  - Security vulnerabilities in user data management.
  - Potential delays in real-time feature integration.

- **Mitigation Strategies:**
  - Utilize scalable cloud services (e.g., Vercel, AWS).
  - Regular code reviews and security audits.
  - Implementation of fallback mechanisms in case of latency issues.

## Next Steps and Action Items

1. **Finalize PRD & Design:** Complete design mockups and technical specifications.
2. **Setup Development Infrastructure:** Initialize the Next.js project and configure the repository.
3. **Begin MVP Development:** Start coding core components and integration of game mechanics.
4. **Review Milestones:** Establish periodic review meetings to assess progress and adjust timelines as necessary.
